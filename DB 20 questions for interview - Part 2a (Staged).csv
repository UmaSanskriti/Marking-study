]","The following rules from the Full Marking Guideline may be invoked when grading students’ answers to this “area of composite figure – no-calculator” question. Section / rule numbers are kept exactly as in the original document.

B) General marking standards  
1. All fractions and ratios must be left in the simplest form unless otherwise stated.  
2. All improper fractions must be converted to mixed numbers unless otherwise stated.  
3. All answers must be precise and exact unless otherwise stated.

C) Common presentation errors  
1. Inappropriate use of equal signs … will be penalized.  
5. Redundancy – Leading zero, trailing zero, and zero place holders … will be penalized.  
12. Labelling for geometry questions needs to strictly follow the question. When the given letters are in capital form, the answers given by students have to also be in capital letter.

D) Units related marking  
1. Angles without a degree sign will be marked down. (Relevant if any angle values are stated.)  
6. The usage of S and c for dollars and cents is acceptable. (Not directly relevant here but governs unit presentation in general.)  
8. Years are considered as units and will be treated accordingly. (General unit guidance.)

E) Alternative format provided by students  
2. Powers in units  
   Original form: cm²  
   - cm2 (Correct)  
   - cm^2 (Correct)  
   - cm square (Correct)  
   - square cm (Correct)  
   - ^cm2 (Wrong)

G) No calculator questions  
When the question states 'Show your working clearly', students' final answer step must include working.

H) Others  
2. If the question is 'what is the number of triangles shaded', we will mark down if students give fractions instead. (By extension, if an exact area is required, giving an unrelated form would be penalised.)

These copied rules cover fraction/precision requirements, correct unit notation for area (cm² variations), proper use of equal signs, avoidance of redundant zeros, geometric labelling, and the obligation to show working in this no-calculator context."

How much water is left in the rectangular tank? Express your answer
in litres.","Volume of water in rectangular tank

Marker's rationale: The student's answer fully matches the solution because the working shows 36000 cm³ for water in the rectangular tank, which is the required evidence for this step.
