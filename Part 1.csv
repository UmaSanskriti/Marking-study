Marker's rationale: The student's answer does not match the solution because it omits the seconds part; hence it is not equivalent to “10 min 0 s”, lacks the required “s” unit, and the format is incomplete.","The student correctly found “10 min” as the number of whole minutes in 600 s, earning the step mark.

Marker's rationale: The student's answer does not match the solution because the expression for the remaining three shops is 31n−90, not the correct 19n−90.

Multiples of 10:  10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100
Ans : 10",2,1,Low Confidence,"S1 step summary: Find the common blinking interval (LCM of 2 s, 5 s and 10 s)
Marker's rationale: The student's answer fully matches the solution because the value 10 appears in all three multiple lists, showing they identified 10 s as the common blinking interval.

S2 step summary: Convert half a minute to seconds
Marker's rationale: The student's answer does not match the solution because there is no conversion of half a minute to 30 s anywhere in the working.

S3 step summary: Calculate how many common intervals fit into 30 s
Marker's rationale: The student's answer does not match the solution because they did not divide 30 s by 10 s to obtain 3; no value ‘3’ is shown.

Final answer step summary: State the total number of times all lights blink together in half a minute
Marker's rationale: The student's answer does not match the solution because the stated total (10) is not mathematically equivalent to the required answer 3. Units are not required and the format is acceptable, but correctness fails.","The common blinking interval was correctly identified as 10 s. The student did not convert half a minute to 30 s, nor show dividing 30 s by 10 s to obtain 3. The final answer “10” is therefore not equivalent to the required “3,” even though formatting and units needs were otherwise acceptable.","[

]","The following rules from the Full Marking Guideline are potentially relevant for grading pupils’ answers to the Christmas-tree blinking-lights question. (Section / rule numbers are kept unchanged.)

B) General marking standards  
3. All answers must be precise and exact unless otherwise stated.

C) Common presentation errors  
1. Inappropriate use of equal signs  
   E.g.  
   - 40% = $300 (wrong)  
   …  
   (Ensure a pupil does not use an unjustified “=” before the final answer.)  

5. Redundancy – Leading zero, trailing zero, and zero place holders  
   E.g.  
   - 173.9 (correct)  
   - 173.90 (wrong) unless question specified 2 decimal places  
   (If a pupil writes something like “03” or “3.0” when the exact answer is 3, apply this rule.)

D) Units related marking  
(There is no specific time-unit requirement for this problem, but pupils might append the word “times”.  None of the listed Unit rules penalise or mandate that, so no extra time-unit rule is extracted.)

H) Others  
6. When students are asked about how the items are grouped, as long as their answers are logically correct, we will give full marks.

(Although the question is not explicitly about grouping, pupils may explain grouping of seconds or blinks in their working; this rule allows flexibility in awarding method marks as long as logic is sound.)"
