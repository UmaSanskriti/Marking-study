B) General marking standards  
1. All fractions and ratios must be left in the simplest form unless otherwise stated.  
3. All answers must be precise and exact unless otherwise stated.  

C) Common presentation errors  
1. Inappropriate use of equal signs  
   – e.g. writing “110 = 3 h” or other non-equivalent statements is penalised.  
5. Redundancy – Leading zero, trailing zero, and zero place holders  
   – e.g. writing 50.0 km/h (wrong unless the question asks for 1 d.p.).  

D) Units related marking  
1. Angles without a degree sign will be marked down.  (Not directly about speed, but it signals that missing or wrong units are penalised; by analogy, speed should be stated with correct units such as km/h.)  
2. Answers that are supposed to be percentage values will need ‘%’ as units. (Extends to requiring correct units in general.)  
8. Years are considered as units and will be treated accordingly.  (Reinforces that time units must be written correctly, e.g. h, hours.)

G) No calculator questions  
When the question states “Show your working clearly”, students’ final answer step must include working.  (Apply if this question appears in a ‘show-working’ section.)

H) Others  
8. When being asked to calculate and then round off, students can round off first and then calculate.  (Relevant if pupils round intermediate speed values and still reach the exact  ?  km/h.)
